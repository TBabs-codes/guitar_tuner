Python Guitar Tuner without ADS!!!!!

Background:
    The ads on my phone's guitar tuner app really drive me up a wall. So, I decided to write code for one without ads.

Libraries Used:
    The following libraries are required to run the guitar tuner:

    pygame, pyaudio, wave, numpy, librosa, *matplotlib

    * matplotlib is useful to see the sound waves and Fourier transform results but not required for the tuner itself.

I hope you enjoy this ad free guitar tuner.
